According to Poyo, founded by Betancourt Cisneros, with the collaboration of John O'Sullivan, to promote purchase of Cuba by the U.S. (9)

According to Mirabel, ""Verdad, one of the longest running and most influential exile newspapers in New York. This Spanish-English bimonthly was distinctly anti-Spanish, pro-slavery, annexationist, and rooted in a transnational and collaborative politics between the United States and Cuba.""

Mirabel: ensured that the offices of La Verdad be located across the street from the Sun’s headquarters at 89 Nassau Street.

""One of the most notable efforts of the annexationists in New York was the establishment of a pro-annexation bilingual newspaper, La Verdad, which appeared biweekly from 1848 to 1853"" (Lisandro Pérez Sugar, Cigars, and Revolution 69). Also p. 109 on Goicouría

John Patrick Leary, in A Cultural History of Underdevelopment, reads La Verdad as the source of an alternate view of the hemisphere: ""The alternative American hemisphere the annexationists and anexionistas imagined seeds the history of inter-American abolition and imperialism with the unmade maps of futures past that remind us, as well, of the histories we have inherited.""

""Concerned that the separatist junta's program and tactics had given the movment a reactionary and proslavery reputation, that year a group of exiles led by Carolos Collins, Lorenzo Alló, and Juan C. Zenea demanded that the movement discuss abolition publicly and make its position clear"" (Poyo 17).
